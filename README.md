ON A SEPARATE NOTE TO MAKE A GITHUB REPO AND CLONE, it will take the name assigned online, so don't be naming it anything different. otherwise you will just need to swap it out

in other news, welcome to javascript <3

JS - Platform independent, comme , so it can run on any device - JVM
it's used for a lot of big web applications....netflix minecraft and google maps
---------------------

websites are made with HTML, CSS AND JS

HTML - builds and define the webpage structure. 
to link a html file...

    <script src="script.js"></script>

and you put this at the end of the body file

HOUSE ANALOGY 
HTML is the foundation of the house. without it, no site
CSS makes it pretty. it's the decor and colour scheme basically - make it accessible btw!
I'm going to guess JS is like the electricity? or the gas and mains stuff

okay js is the brain of the site as it enables functionality....you can xombine variables using concatenation and interpolation.... i feel like i should know what those are...see w2
