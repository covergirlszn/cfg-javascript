ON A SEPARATE NOTE TO MAKE A GITHUB REPO AND CLONE, it will take the name assigned online, so don't be naming it anything different. otherwise you will just need to swap it out

in other news, welcome to javascript <3

JS - Platform independent, comme JAVA or python, so it can run on any device - JVM
it's used for a lot of big web applications....netflix minecraft and google maps

---

websites are made with HTML, CSS AND JS

HTML - builds and define the webpage structure.
to link a html file...

    <script src="script.js"></script>

and you put this at the end of the body file

HOUSE ANALOGY
HTML is the foundation of the house. without it, no site
CSS makes it pretty. it's the decor and colour scheme basically - make it accessible btw!
ensuring nobarriers that prevent interaction/access to the website
this includes color change on sites and resizingwebsites
seo ....non responsive site to the BACK of google. make ressponsive
I'm going to guess JS is like the electricity? or the gas and mains stuff

---

yeah i was right.....the js gives functionality and ensures interactivity....gas electic and mains

---

okay js is the brain of the site as it enables functionality....you can xombine variables using concatenation and interpolation.... i feel like i should know what those are...see w2

DOM. document object module. due to dom we can change html of a site using js
look at the dom tree for visualisation

---

Id is used to identify diff elements. esp when doing with javascrip
script goes at the end of the body...this is because it goes line by line so if you wereto put it at the top....
with css and that, tht spo the monent you mention it then it runs the js. then the uncalled elements start bugging becaus eyou haven't finished running through the nhtml yet

hencewise. put it at the bottonm

like imagine a bottle with a hole at the top and before you use it you need to tape it. like before you run the site you need to run the html down define all ids and variables THEN get into the js. yeah
