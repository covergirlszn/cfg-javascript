ON A SEPARATE NOTE TO MAKE A GITHUB REPO AND CLONE, it will take the name assigned online, so don't be naming it anything different. otherwise you will just need to swap it out

in other news, welcome to javascript <3

JS - Platform independent, comme JAVA or python, so it can run on any device - JVM
it's used for a lot of big web applications....netflix minecraft and google maps
---------------------

websites are made with HTML, CSS AND JS

HTML - builds and define the webpage structure. 
to link a html file...

    <script src="script.js"></script>

and you put this at the end of the body file

HOUSE ANALOGY 
HTML is the foundation of the house. without it, no site
CSS makes it pretty. it's the decor and colour scheme basically - make it accessible btw!
    ensuring nobarriers that prevent interaction/access to the website
    this includes color change on sites and resizingwebsites
    seo ....non responsive site to the BACK of google. make ressponsive
I'm going to guess JS is like the electricity? or the gas and mains stuff
________________________________________________
yeah i was right.....the js gives functionality and ensures interactivity....gas electic and mains

_______________________________________________________________
okay js is the brain of the site as it enables functionality....you can xombine variables using concatenation and interpolation.... i feel like i should know what those are...see w2

DOM. document object module. due to dom we can change html of a site using js
look at the dom tree for visualisation
